# **Mini Project 3**

> This project uses flask to create a web application.
> The structure is based off of a tutorial, however the bulk of the project has been
> heavily modified and several files have been added using different bootstrap techniques. 
>
> My project is a web application based around board games. It has the ability to let users
> register and account, login, and post. There is an about page and a contact page, both of 
> which utilize bootstrap methods.
