            Welcome to our About Us page! This is a place where board game enthusiasts can come together and discuss
            anything and everything to do with board games. While this is just a rough draft, per se, one day this site,
            with the help of everyone with any interest in board games, will be filled with a board game encyclopedia!
            Here's
            to the future!
